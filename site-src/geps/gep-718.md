# GEP-718: Consolidate ServiceName shortcut in RouteForwardTo

Issue URL: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/718

Status: implementable

## TLDR

Drop `ServiceName` shortcut from `RouteForwardTo` and `HTTPRouteForwardTo` and
introduce `Service` as the default `kind` for `RouteForwardTo.BackendRef` and
`HTTPRouteForwardTo.BackendRef`.

## Motivation

Within `RouteForwardTo` (and `HTTPRouteForwardTo` by extension) there exists
two mechanisms to specify the upstream network endpoint where the traffic should
be forwarded to:
- `ServiceName`: the name of the Kubernetes Service
- `BackendRef`: a LocalObjectReference to a resource, this is an extension point in the API

While working on [#685](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/685),
it came to light that:
1. `BackendRef` itself could be used to point to a Kubernetes Service
2. With [GEP-709](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/711),
there will be a need to introduce a new `namespace` field which will enable use-cases to forward
traffic to a services and backends located in different namespaces

While (1) can be fixed with more validation and documentation, it only solves for
the specific case. (2) requires adding two fields: `serviceNamespace`
and `BackendRef.Namespace` - something we would like to avoid since the `serviceName`
field was introduced only as a shortcut and adding more service-specific fields
defeats the original purpose.

These problems are in addition to the original problem that
[#685](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/685) attempts to solve:
clarifying port requirements when a port is required or not.
We have been updating documentation to tackle such corner-cases but that
continues to result in more and more elaborations. Some excerpts from our
existing documentation:
```
	// ServiceName refers to the name of the Service to mirror matched requests
	// to. When specified, this takes the place of BackendRef. If both
	// BackendRef and ServiceName are specified, ServiceName will be given
	// precedence.

	// BackendRef is a local object reference to mirror matched requests to. If
	// both BackendRef and ServiceName are specified, ServiceName will be given
	// precedence.

	// Weight specifies the proportion of HTTP requests forwarded to the backend
	// referenced by the ServiceName or BackendRef field. This is computed as

	// Port specifies the destination port number to use for the
	// backend referenced by the ServiceName or BackendRef field.
	// If unspecified, the destination port in the request is used
	// when forwarding to a backendRef or serviceName.
```


## Proposal

- Remove the `ServiceName` field from `RouteForwardTo` and `HTTPRouteForwardTo`
- Introduce `Service` as a default for `BackendRef.Kind`
- Apply the same to HTTPRequestMirrorFilter to avoid issues like [#655](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/655)

## API


The updated `RouteForwardTo` will be:
(`HTTPRouteForwardTo` has been omitted for brevity)

```go
// RouteForwardTo defines how a Route should forward a request.
type RouteForwardTo struct {
	// BackendRef is a reference to a backend to forward matched requests to.
	//
	// If the referent cannot be found, the rule is not included in the route.
	// The controller should raise the "ResolvedRefs" condition on the Gateway
	// with the "DegradedRoutes" reason. The gateway status for this route should
	// be updated with a condition that describes the error more specifically.
	//
	// The protocol to use is defined using AppProtocol field (introduced in
	// Kubernetes 1.18) in the Service resource. In the absence of the
	// AppProtocol field a `gateway.networking.k8s.io/app-protocol` annotation on the
	// BackendPolicy resource may be used to define the protocol. If the
	// AppProtocol field is available, this annotation should not be used. The
	// AppProtocol field, when populated, takes precedence over the annotation
	// in the BackendPolicy resource. For custom backends, it is encouraged to
	// add a semantically-equivalent field in the Custom Resource Definition.
	//
	// Support: Core (Kubernetes Service)
	// Support: Custom (any other resource)
	//
	// +optional
    // +kubebuilder:default={kind: "service"}
	BackendRef *LocalObjectReference `json:"backendRef,omitempty"`

	// Port specifies the destination port number to use for the
	// backend referenced by BackendRef field. Port is required when the backend
    // is a Kubernetes Service.
	//
	// Support: Core
	//
	// +optional
	Port *PortNumber `json:"port,omitempty"`

	// Weight specifies the proportion of HTTP requests forwarded to the backend
	// referenced by the ServiceName or BackendRef field. This is computed as
	// weight/(sum of all weights in this ForwardTo list). For non-zero values,
	// there may be some epsilon from the exact proportion defined here
	// depending on the precision an implementation supports. Weight is not a
	// percentage and the sum of weights does not need to equal 100.
	//
	// If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
	// of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
	// traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
	// defaults to 1.
	//
	// Support: Extended
	//
	// +optional
	// +kubebuilder:default=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Maximum=1000000
	Weight *int32 `json:"weight,omitempty"`
}
```

For Kubernetes Services, the API will look like the following:

```yaml
...
forwardTo:
- backendRef:
    name: foo-service-v1
  port: 80
  weight: 80
- backendRef:
    name: foo-service-canary
  port: 80
  weight: 20
...
```

Here, the `kind` field is omitted as it will be injected as a default.

For custom backends, the API will look like the following:

```yaml
...
forwardTo:
- backendRef:
    name: foo-v1
    kind: server
    group: networking.acme.io
  port: 80
  weight: 80
- backendRef:
    name: foo-v1-canary
    kind: server
    group: networking.acme.io
  port: 80
  weight: 20
...
```

## Note on future consolidation

It has been noted that `forwardTo` doesn't flow as good as `backendRefs`.
We could consider further consolidating the YAML if API conventions allow for the
following:

```yaml
backendRefs:
- name: foo-v1
  kind: server
  group: networking.acme.io
  port: 80
  weight: 80
- name: foo-v1-canary
  kind: server
  group: networking.acme.io
  port: 80
  weight: 20
```

This is current out-of-scope from this GEP and could be considered in a future
GEP.

## Alternatives

### Rename serviceName to backendName

As suggested in [this comment](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/685#discussion_r667285837),
we could buy the best of both the worlds by introducing `backendName`:

```yaml
forwardTo:
- backendName: foo
  port: 80
    kind: <defaults to Service>
```

While this saves one line of YAML (`backendRef:`), it could be potentially
violating the `Naming of the reference field`
[API convention](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#naming-of-the-reference-field).
Most of our object references are of the form `XRef`.

## Out of scope

- Rework moving `port`, `weight` fields into the `BackendRef` struct.
- Rename `forwardTo` to `backends`
